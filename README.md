# DataScience
Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository serves as a collection of personal projects that I have developed as a Data Scientist. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my skills, knowledge, and experience in the field of data science. Here, you will find various projects that I have worked on, ranging from exploratory data analysis to machine learning and deep learning models.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a separate project. Each project directory contains the following components:

Project Name: A descriptive name for the project.

Project Description: A brief overview of the project, explaining its objectives and the problem it aims to solve.
